===== What is this? =====

**This is the information page for Zim's support IRC chat room.**

Channel:  #zim-wiki

[[http://zim-wiki.org/|Zim Desktop Wiki]] is a graphical text editor used to maintain a collection of wiki pages.

Zim is supported on GNU/Linux and BSD desktops, and also on Windows. It is reportedly possible to install it in OS X as well, but there is no official installer.

===== How can I access the Zim chat room? =====

If you are already an expert IRC user, use your favorite IRC client to access the chat room with the parameters listed above. Freenode's web site has [[http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml|more details about connecting to the network]].

If you are new to IRC, the easiest way to access the chat room is to go to

	https://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23zim-wiki

to run Freenode's instance of qwebirc directly in your browser. You don't have to configure or register anything; just pick a nickname no one else is using.

===== What kind of discussion is allowed in the chat room? =====

You can talk about anything related to Zim Dekstop Wiki:
* Ask questions
* Discuss ideas for customizing and enhancing Zim
* Get help solving a problem

If you want to share a large piece of text relevant to your question (such as a debug log), please post it on a site like [[http://pastebin.com/|Pastebin]], and then share just the URL in the chat room. Don't forget to make sure there are no secrets (passwords, API keys, etc.) in your post!

Off-topic discussions are welcome whenever nothing else is happening. Please follow [[http://www.freenode.net/policy.shtml|Freenode policies]]; no commercial advertising, unlawful behavior, or impolite topics.

===== May I be constantly logged into the chat room and offer help to others? =====

Please do!

===== Who is in charge? =====

[[http://www.glump.net|Brendan Kidwell]] (**bkidwell**) is the channel owner. He is also the maintainer of the [[http://www.glump.net/software/zim-windows|Windows installer package for Zim]].

===== No one is responding to me. =====

**bkidwell** is almost always logged in and virtually lurking, but sometimes neither of them are actually at a computer or connected from a handheld. Try again later.

===== Where else can I get help? =====

* [[http://zim-wiki.org/|Zim's main web site]].
* Read the[[http://www.zim-wiki.org/manual/Start.html| manual]].
* Read the [[https://github.com/jaap-karssenberg/zim-wiki/wiki|public support wiki]].
* Check the [[https://bugs.launchpad.net/zim/|bug tracker]] and see if you're dealing with a known bug.
* Join the [[https://launchpad.net/~zim-wiki|mailing list]] and/or read the [[http://lists.launchpad.net/zim-wiki|mailing list archive]].

If you think you have encountered a bug but you're not sure, posting on the mailing list is a good way to find out. Make sure you explain your setup (your OS, your desktop environment, and whether you have a current or older version of Zim) and how to reproduce your problem.

===== How did you make this web page? =====

I wrote it in a Zim notebook, of course. [[colophon|See my notes.]]
